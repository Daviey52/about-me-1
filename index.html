<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name is Mark and I am currently a Code Fellows student. Before all of that, I am originally from Chicago and moved to Washington because of the military. After my service, I was a bartender for a bit. I then moved from Tacoma, WA to Seattle, WA to pursue a degree in Digital Audio Engineering and Electronic/MIDI Music Production at Shoreline Community College. From then, I chose to try out personal training since one of my hobbies is CrossFit. A couple of clients of mine told me that I would great in the software development field, so I decided to give it a try. My goal is to obtain a career in the software development field. Hope you enjoyed getting to know a bit about me! Thank you!
